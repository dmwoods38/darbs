# DARBS
Bootstrapping scripts for Debian install, the name is a reference to Luke Smith's LARBS.
Definitely a work in progress.
After upgrading the wifi card to one that has free software support now using debian without the non-free repos. Removed some packages as well as I am now using MATE w/i3.
